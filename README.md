# Miscellaneous Notes

* Footprints, models, etc., by their respective authors
* Some footprints, schematics, models are from these sources:
  * [Component Search Engine](https://componentsearchengine.com)
  * [Snap EDA](https://snapeda.com)
  * [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com)
* Useful tools:
  * [EasyEDA2KiCAD](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py)
  * [JLC Parts Finder](https://yaqwsx.github.io/jlcparts/)


# KiCAD Configuration Notes

Using EasyEDA2KiCAD:

* Create a Path Substitution
  * Use main KiCAD window: Prefernces -> Configure Paths...
  * `EASYEDA2KICAD`
  * [Git Repository](https://github.com/LispEngineer/KiCAD_Libraries)
* Create a Footprint Library
  * `easyeda2kicad` Nickname
  * `${EASYEDA2KICAD}/easyeda2kicad.pretty`
* Create a Symbol Library
  * `easyeda2kicad` Nickname
  * `${EASYEDA2KICAD}/easyeda2kicad.kicad_sym` Library Path


# Status

* Schematic: Done
* LCSC part IDs: Almost Done
  * Need non-Red LEDs
* Schematic symbols: Done
* Footprints: Done
* 3D models: Done
* PCB Layout: Done
* Production 1 run: Done - in shipping


## TODOs

* Find a much smaller Opto-isolator for MIDI than the one chosen here
  * [TLP2362](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/us/semiconductor/product/isolators-solid-state-relays/detail.TLP2362.html)
    is used by [Ksoloti 0.6](https://ksoloti.github.io/5-resources.html). Tested to work with
    1.8kΩ pull-up resistor instead of the schematic's 2.7kΩ.
    (Also worked with no pull-up resistor!)
* Use a 4-pin 32kHz clock?
* RN1 footprint and 3D model look a little bit off - footprint is a bit too small?
* Test points/pins
* MCU Pin 24 is not used - it is I2S1_MCK

# Board Layout Notes

4-layer design with Signal/GND/GND/Signal for EVT board.

Will do most important routing first on the top copper layer:
* Decoupling/bypass capacitors
* Clock signals
* High speed signals
  * USB
  * DAC
  * SWD

Remaining signals will be routed using "Manhattan routing."
That is, one signal layer will run up/down, the other will
run left/right, mostly.
* Top layer: up/down
* Bottom layer: left/right

After that, do these routings:
* Audio signals
* MIDI signals
* SPI
* I²C
* UI (Buttons, LEDs)
* GPIO
* Power

Fill in some positive power areas with fill.

Finally, the signal layers will be filled with GND at the end,
and the ground planes should be stitched together with lots
of vias.

## After Layout Is Done

* DRC check
* Cleanup Tracks & Vias


# BOM Notes

* Docs say you need a 4.7 uF ceramic capacitor with low ESR DS11853 Rev 9 page 105
  * Samsung CL10A475KO8NNNC works *but* Datasheet doesn't say what the ESR is, just "low ESR"
  * [Notes on the Cap](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus-products/how-supply-stm32f446ret6/td-p/635424)

* [ISOM8710](https://www.ti.com/product/ISOM8710) 
  is a drop-in replacement for the
  [TLP2362](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/us/semiconductor/product/isolators-solid-state-relays/detail.TLP2362.html)
  * Same form factor
  * Same functionality (tested on a breadboard)
  * Same circuit
  * Does not seem to be carried at JLCPCB


# Notes for future

* Use fewer header types, they're all extended parts
* Don't use the Resistor Network - due to the Extended parts fee from JLC
  * OTOH there are no 56Ω resistors in the Basic parts library
  * C25127 is an extended part 0402
  * C17714 is an 0805 47Ω
* Add I/O activity LEDs for MIDI & serial?
* Add a pin for VBUS (5V from USB) and USB GND
* Add pins for the TRS jacks
* Get a 4-way switch for gain?
* Rewrire the headphone amp like Pimoroni?
* Move console from UART3 to UART2
  * Move console pins next to SWD pins for easy use with STLink

Longer term
* Move to an STM32H7 device
* Move to a [higher pin-count device](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32h7-series/products.html)
  * LQFP 64, 100, 144, 176, 208
    * low-profile quad flat package - LQFP 64 currently in use
  * TFBGA 216, 225, 240+25
    * Thin Profile Fine Pitch Ball Grid Array
    * thinner than other BGA packages - Gemini
  * UFBGA 144, 169, 176+25
    * ultra fine pitch ball grid array
  * VFQFPN 68
    * thermally enhanced very thin profile fine pitch quad flat package no lead (Gemini)
  * WLCSP 132, 156
    * [Wafer-Level Chip Scale Packaging](https://www.flashpcb.com/blog/QFP-QFN-BGA-WLSCP)
* Add an SDRAM
