# Board Layout Notes

4-layer design with Signal/GND/GND/Signal for EVT board.

Will do most important routing first on the top copper layer:
* Decoupling/bypass capacitors
* Clock signals
* High speed signals
  * USB
  * DAC

Remaining signals will be routed using "Manhattan routing."
That is, one signal layer will run up/down, the other will
run left/right, mostly.

After that, do these routings:
* Audio signals
* MIDI signals
* SPI
* IÂ²C
* UI (Buttons, LEDs)
* GPIO
* Routed power

The signal layers will be filled with GND at the end.

TODO: Change P1 pinout to make the routing of the
P1 signals easier.
